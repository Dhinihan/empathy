      Could be useful to link here how to change your password or how to
      recover it. Need to write that section.

    If you try to connect and you get a message saying <gui>Authentication failed</gui>,
    your instant messaging service is not allowing you to connect because it does not
    recognize your username or password for some reason.

        Make sure that you have registered for an account with the service you
        are trying to connect to. If you do not have an account, most services
        will not allow you to connect.

        Click the <gui>Edit Account</gui> button in the error message. Type
        your username and password again to make sure that they are correct.
        Deselect the <gui>Enabled</gui> box next to the name of your account and
        then select it to try to connect to the service again.
