Empathy is split in different processes:
- src/empathy: contact list, considered as the main UI
- src/empathy-chat: chat UI
- src/empathy-call: call UI
- src/empathy-accounts: UI to configure IM accounts
- src/empathy-debugger: debug tool

Each process can be run directly from source without having to be installed to
its prefix. You just have to define an appropriate environment using the
wrapper found in the tools/ directory.. For example:
  ./tools/empathy-env ./src/empathy

The chat and call UI are automatically started by telepathy-mission-control
when receiving or requesting a chat/call. In order to use your custom version
you have to kill any existing instance of empathy-{chat,call} and then start
it with EMPATHY_PERSIST=1 to prevent it from auto exiting if there is no
channel to handle. For example:
  EMPATHY_PERSIST=1 ./tools/empathy-env ./src/empathy-chat

Debugging can be turned on using EMPATHY_DEBUG=all and logged to a file
with EMPATHY_LOGFILE=/tmp/empathy.log
