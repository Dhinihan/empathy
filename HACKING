Empathy is split in different processes:
- src/empathy: contact list, considered as the main UI
- src/empathy-chat: chat UI
- src/empathy-call: call UI
- src/empathy-accounts: UI to configure IM accounts
- src/empathy-debugger: debug tool

Each process can be run directly from source without having to be installed to
its prefix. You just have to define the environment variable EMPATHY_SRCDIR
to the path of your empathy source dir. For example:
  export EMPATHY_SRCDIR=/home/cassidy/gnome/empathy

The chat and call UI are automatically started by telepathy-mission-control
when receiving or requesting a chat/call. In order to use your custom version
you have to kill any existing instance of empathy-{chat,call} and then start
it with EMPATHY_PERSIST=1 to prevent it from auto exiting if there is no
channel to handle. For example:
  EMPATHY_PERSIST=1 ./src/empathy-chat

Debugging can be turned on using EMPATHY_DEBUG=all and logged to a file
with EMPATHY_LOGFILE=/tmp/empathy.log
